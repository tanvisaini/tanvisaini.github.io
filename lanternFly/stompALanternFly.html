  <p> The Spotted Lanternfly is an invasive species native to Asia. In 2014 it was found in
    Pennsylvania, and has since spread to multiple counties which are now quarantined.
    <br> <br>
    If you see a spotted lanternfly, it's imperative to immediately kill it! Squash it, smash
    it...just get rid of it. In the fall, these bugs will lay egg masses with 30-50 eggs each.
    <br> <br>
    The spotted lanternfly causes serious damage including oozing sap, wilting, leaf curling and
    dieback in trees, vines, crops and many other types of plants. In addition to plant damage, when spotted
    lanternflies feed, they excrete a sugary substance, called honeydew, that encourages the growth of black sooty mold.
    This mold is harmless to people however it causes damage to plants. In counties infested and quarantined for spotted
    lanternfly, residents report hundreds of these bad bugs that affect their quality of life and ability to enjoy the
    outdoors during the spring
    and summer months. Spotted lanternflies will cover trees, swarm in the air, and their honeydew
    can coat decks and play equipment.
