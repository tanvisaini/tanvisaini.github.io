    <h3> ‚ÄúConsider a future device ‚Ä¶  in which an individual stores all his books, records, 
        and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding 
        speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.‚Äù</h3>

    <p> Reading this article was very surreal because the author, Vannevar Bush, predicted a lot of the 
        information technology we use today. He predicted the use of Wikipedia and being able to outsource
         different articles and images on a screen. He also understood that there could be a certain 
         pathway for every user that could showcase one's thought process and how they landed on that certain webpage. </p>

    <p> Some parts of this article gave me the chills because he is urging scientists and engineers to 
        stop going down a destructive path. He addresses that its more important to share knowledge with 
        one another rather than paving the way towards more dangerous technologies.</p>

        <p> The only times that they ever surfaced in the art world 
            was as a subject within an artwork. </p>
        <p> The church remained predominant in shaping the image of women, as either Eve, 
            to blame for the ills of mankind, or the Virgin Mary, 
            untouched by the complex humanity of men </p>
        <p> The best time to be born a woman is tomorrow. </p>
