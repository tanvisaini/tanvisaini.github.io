    <p> Poets, as the caretakers of language, if by no other contested purpose of poetry— </p>

    <p> I want a poetry of proximity </p>
    <p> not just by </p>
    <p>theme or figure,</p>     
    <p> metonymy or metaphor, </p>   
    <p>but by physical proximity, a proximity by frame. </p>    
</div>
</div>

<p> This means allowing into the lyric the multiplicity of languages we are subjected to and create today. The ways in which we measure 
    or create arguments of proximity are the ways in which we enlarge and complicate 
    <p>the I, </p>
    <p>the here, </p>
    <p>the we </p>
    <p>into ones that reach where our (APPLAUSE) does not, out where we have yet to hear.</p>
